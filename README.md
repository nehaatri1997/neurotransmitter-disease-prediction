Neurotransmitter-Based Disease Prediction Model
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of disease based on neurotransmitter levels, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model on a sample dataset, with visualizations provided for data exploration and feature importance.

# Overview
This project demonstrates how neurotransmitter levels may be linked to disease states and how a machine learning model can be used to predict disease likelihood. The model is trained using a sample dataset, where higher values of neurotransmitters may correlate with disease presence.

# Dataset
The dataset is a simple, synthetic collection with the following columns:

dopamine: Dopamine level of the individual
serotonin: Serotonin level of the individual
gaba: GABA level of the individual
disease: Target variable (1 for disease, 0 for no disease)

# Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neurotransmitter-disease-prediction.git
cd neurotransmitter-disease-prediction
Run the Script: Run the code in Python to train the model and see the results.

#Script Breakdown
The script follows these steps:

Data Creation: Creates a synthetic dataset for disease prediction.
Visualization: Plots pairwise relationships between features, color-coded by disease status.
Train-Test Split: Divides data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trains a RandomForestClassifier on the training set.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance.
Feature Importance: Visualizes the importance of each feature in predicting disease.
Model Training and Evaluation
The model is evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the model’s correctness.
#Classification Report: Shows precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.

#Feature Importance
The RandomForestClassifier provides feature importances, which highlight the most influential neurotransmitters in the prediction. This is displayed using a bar chart, where higher bars indicate higher importance for disease prediction.
